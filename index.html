        <h2>Freshman from Florence, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Spanish and Cross-Cultural Service with a minor in German. I work at a YMCA as a lifeguard, swim instructor, and swim team coach.</p>
         <p>
            I am active in my local church in Greenville : Rocksprings Baptist Church, as well as my church at home: Florence Baptist Temple. I enjoy doing outreach with both of my churches and my university. After graduation, I plan to be a full-time missionary, so outreach is one of my favorite activities.
         </p> 
         <p>
            During my free time, I love to swim laps and speak Spanish! I also enoying painting, drawing, and playing the ukulele.
